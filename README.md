### 👨‍💻 About Me

I started my journey in programming with **C#**, developing small desktop projects.

Later, I explored game development with **Java**, where I built a few 2D games.  
Though that phase was brief, it sparked a deep passion for **creating systems** that feel alive and purposeful.

Today, I focus fully on Web, delivering fast, reliable, and scalable software.
